# EmydexFarmTest

By John Sheppard of Cairns Australia.

A short demonstration of my object oriented skills as per that required of thy specifications!

With superior luck (and skill), I shall not flunk this test and proceed into the depths of Emydex where I shall become a tight unit within. One unit, for the force of good and all things efficient and productive.

Thank you kindly for paving the way before me.
